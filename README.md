## Directory 

### ðŸ”¹'DevOps'


AWS, Docker, and Kubernetes form the backbone of modern MLOps workflows by streamlining development, deployment, and scaling of ML models. They enable containerization (via Docker), orchestration (via Kubernetes), and cloud-native automation (via AWS), ensuring reliable and reproducible ML pipelines.


---

### ðŸ”¹`Kserve/`


A machine learning model deployed using **KServe** on Kubernetes for predicting crop diseases.
- Includes: `disease_prediction.py`, `inference.py`, `deployment.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, trained model & encoders.
- Features: Dockerization, custom inference logic, KServe REST deployment.

---

### ðŸ”¹`Kuberflow/`



A Kubeflow pipeline to predict **crop disease risk** based on environmental features.
- Shows end-to-end workflow: data processing, model inference, and visualization using pipeline components.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `Observability/`


Basic observability assignment demonstrating **Elasticsearch + Kibana** setup.
- Includes configuration and data indexing steps to monitor logs/metrics.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `Python/`

#### â€¢ 'Assignment_1/'
Python script showcasing basic automation or scripting tasks.
Useful for learning scripting basics before full ML pipelines.

#### â€¢ 'Assignment_2/'
Flask-based web app featuring:

images/, templates/, static/ â€” assets for the web frontend

Web interface for prediction or visualization (likely related to ML model)

#### â€¢ 'Assignment_3/'
Data analysis on wine quality dataset (winequality-red.csv).
Python script (Assignment3.py) demonstrates data visualization and basic ML techniques.

#### â€¢ 'Assignment_4/'
Customer segmentation using Mall Customer dataset (Mall_Customers.csv).
Python script (Assignment4.py) applies clustering techniques like K-Means.

####â€¢ 'Assignment_5/'
Sales data analysis with supermarket sales dataset (supermarket_sales.csv).
Python script (Assignment5.py) includes data preprocessing, analysis, and sales visualization (sales_over_time.png).

####â€¢ 'Assignment_6/'
Iris flower classification using the Iris dataset (Iris.csv).
Python script (Assignment6.py) performs basic machine learning model training and evaluation.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `Streamlit/`

#### â€¢ `Assignment1_Visualizing CSV Data/`
Streamlit-based dashboard to visualize uploaded CSV files using interactive charts.
- Allows users to upload any dataset and explore it visually.

#### â€¢ `Assignment2_Weather_App/`
A weather dashboard built with Streamlit fetching real-time data from an external API.
- Users can input a city and get weather details like temperature, humidity, etc.

#### â€¢ `Assignment3_Sentiment_Analysis/`
Sentiment analysis web app using NLP libraries and Streamlit UI.
- Input a sentence and get sentiment prediction (Positive/Negative).

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- Docker, Kubernetes
- KServe, Kubeflow Pipelines
- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit, Flask
- Elasticsearch (for Observability)

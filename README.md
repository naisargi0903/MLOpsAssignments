## Directory Overview

### ðŸ”¹`Kserve/`


A machine learning model deployed using **KServe** on Kubernetes for predicting crop diseases.
- Includes: `disease_prediction.py`, `inference.py`, `deployment.yaml`, `Dockerfile`, trained model & encoders.
- Features: Dockerization, custom inference logic, KServe REST deployment.

---

### ðŸ”¹`Kuberflow/`



A Kubeflow pipeline to predict **crop disease risk** based on environmental features.
- Shows end-to-end workflow: data processing, model inference, and visualization using pipeline components.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `Observability/`


Basic observability assignment demonstrating **Elasticsearch + Kibana** setup.
- Includes configuration and data indexing steps to monitor logs/metrics.

---

### ðŸ”¹ `Python/`

#### â€¢ `Assignment_1/`
Python script showcasing basic automation or scripting tasks.
- Useful for learning scripting basics before full ML pipelines.

#### â€¢ `Assignment_2/`
Flask-based web app featuring:
- `images/`, `templates/`, `static/` â€” assets for web frontend
- Web interface for prediction or visualization (likely related to ML model)

---

### ðŸ”¹ `Streamlit/`

#### â€¢ `Assignment1_Visualizing CSV Data/`
Streamlit-based dashboard to visualize uploaded CSV files using interactive charts.
- Allows users to upload any dataset and explore it visually.

#### â€¢ `Assignment2_Weather_App/`
A weather dashboard built with Streamlit fetching real-time data from an external API.
- Users can input a city and get weather details like temperature, humidity, etc.

#### â€¢ `Assignment3_Sentiment_Analysis/`
Sentiment analysis web app using NLP libraries and Streamlit UI.
- Input a sentence and get sentiment prediction (Positive/Negative).

## ðŸ›  Requirements
